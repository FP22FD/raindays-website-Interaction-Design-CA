# Rainydays website

<!-- A simple overview of use/purpose. -->

The `Rainydays` website is a e-commerce shop for sport and outdoors jackets.

The website is hosted at the following url: <https://luxury-halva-7c3f63.netlify.app>

## Description

<!-- An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use. -->

The main goal of this repository is to implement the Figma design I made for the `Rainydays website` in the previous CA.

The website implementation has been made with `HTML` and `CSS` to practice:

- responsive design (concepts, media queries, etc),
- semantic html 5,
- DRY (css variables, structured code, etc),
- image optimization,
- accessibily concepts (WCAG),
- developer tools (VS Code, Prettier, DevTools, Github, Netlify, etc)
- code validation tools

Implemented structure flows:

- users can access the site by desktop and mobile advice.
- users will be able to browse all available products and pay for them at checkout.
- the site has a public GitHub repository and is deployed using Netlify.

The website code has been validated using the following tools:

- check html validity: <https://validator.w3.org/>

- check css validity: <https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/>

- check redirect links: <https://validator.w3.org/checklink>

## Dependencies

<!-- - Describe any prerequisites, libraries, OS version, etc., needed before installing the program.
- ex. Windows 10 -->

To develop the website I have used `Visual Studio Code` with `Prettier` formatter extension.

No other tools are required to compile or run the website.

The Figma prototypes from the previous CA:

- [Figma Mobile prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/o9Y8vfut7qEa2hOQ5RBPBm/Design1_FP?page-id=924%3A505&node-id=1139%3A899&viewport=472%2C109%2C0.34&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=1139%3A899&show-proto-sidebar=1)
  
- [Figma Desktop prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/o9Y8vfut7qEa2hOQ5RBPBm/Design1_FP?page-id=924%3A506&node-id=1139%3A1932&viewport=796%2C261%2C0.11&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=1139%3A1932&show-proto-sidebar=1)

In the implemented website version, few improvements were made based on the Tutor feedbacks.
