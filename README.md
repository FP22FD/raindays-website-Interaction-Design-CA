# Rainydays website

<!-- A simple overview of use/purpose. -->

The `Rainydays` website is a e-commerce shop for sport and outdoors jackets.

## UX improved version

The `main` branch is the starting point where the UX improvements have been made.

The improved version is available in the branch `improvements`: <https://github.com/FP22FD/raindays-website-Interaction-Design-CA/tree/improvements>. Details in the [Readme](https://github.com/FP22FD/raindays-website-Interaction-Design-CA/blob/improvements/README.md).

The deployed versions are:

- original static website (without API): <https://luxury-halva-7c3f63.netlify.app>
- Improved Website with API, before UX improvements: <https://glistening-hummingbird-317e80.netlify.app/>
- Final Website with UX improvements (`improvements` branch): <https://improvements--glistening-hummingbird-317e80.netlify.app/>

## Description

<!-- An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use. -->

The main goal of this repository is to implement the Figma design I made for the `Rainydays website` in the previous CA.

The website implementation has been made with `HTML` and `CSS` to practice:

- responsive design (concepts, media queries, etc),
- semantic html 5,
- DRY (css variables, structured code, etc),
- image optimization,
- accessibily concepts (WCAG),
- developer tools (VS Code, Prettier, DevTools, Github, Netlify, etc)
- code validation tools

Implemented structure flows:

- users can access the site by desktop and mobile devices (breakpoint at 800px).
- users will be able to browse all available products and pay for them at checkout.
- the site has a public GitHub repository and is deployed using Netlify.

The website code has been validated using the following tools:

- check html validity: <https://validator.w3.org/>

- check css validity: <https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/>

- check redirect links: <https://validator.w3.org/checklink>

## Dependencies

<!-- - Describe any prerequisites, libraries, OS version, etc., needed before installing the program.
- ex. Windows 10 -->

To develop the website I have used `Visual Studio Code` with `Prettier` formatter extension.

No other tools are required to compile or run the website.

The Figma prototypes from the previous CA:

- [Figma Mobile prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/o9Y8vfut7qEa2hOQ5RBPBm/Design1_FP?page-id=924%3A505&node-id=1139%3A899&viewport=472%2C109%2C0.34&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=1139%3A899&show-proto-sidebar=1)
- [Figma Desktop prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/o9Y8vfut7qEa2hOQ5RBPBm/Design1_FP?page-id=924%3A506&node-id=1139%3A1932&viewport=796%2C261%2C0.11&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=1139%3A1932&show-proto-sidebar=1)

NB. The implemented website version is slightly different, because few improvements to the Figma/design files were made based on the `Design course` feedbacks from the Tutor.
